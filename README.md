# Letter_Recognition
Built a Letter Recognition using Convolution Neural Network. Used the datasets of ENIST and extracted the small English letter and sorted it according to the categories. Achieved a 90% accuracy on test set. Trained it using Google Colab to access the GPU.

You can look the dataset on https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-handprinted-forms-and-characters-nist-special-database-19 .
